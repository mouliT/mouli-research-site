# Torque Ripple in Switched Reluctance Motor

Torque in an SRM is given by:

$$
T = \frac{1}{2} i^2 \frac{dL(\theta)}{d\theta}
$$

## SRM Structure

The doubly salient structure of the SRM causes variation in inductance with rotor position.

## Torque Ripple Phenomenon (Animation)

The ripple appears due to phase commutation and nonlinear inductance profile.

## Torque Waveform

This waveform shows high ripple at low speed operation.
